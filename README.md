# Weather-Api
This project uses a web API to call weather data (based on city), and depending on the temperature the background color changes transitioning gradually.These are some examples of different inputs are in this repo, they are the PNG files.

The API source we use is: https://openweathermap.org/. There are several Free API options that you can choose from, with detailed information and pricing info

To have this code running for you you will need to go to the API section and select what api you want to use, and sign up. After making an account you will be given an api key that gives you access to requesting data, insert this key into the code as shown in other files in this repo. in the Javascript file its where API KEY HERE is written.
